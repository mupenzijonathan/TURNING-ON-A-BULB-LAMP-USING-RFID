# TURNING-ON-A-BULB-LAMP-USING-RFID
RFID enables many Human-computer interaction (HCI) applications include control lighting system; the control of lighting system is made normally with famous way of showing rfid tag or rfid card to an rfid reader (module).[2]  The rfid module hold information related to rfid tags and rfid cards, only authorized tags and cards would be able to access to the system wirelessly by putting the rfid tag or card near to rfid reader to avoid disturbance or unwanted switching and It needs the Arduino to be programmed.[2] Lighting bulb lamp require high voltage than one used by Arduino thatâ€™s why we include the relay to switch ON or OFF the bulb lamp.
